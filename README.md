# Zigzag Traversal of a 2D Array (Java)

This Java program traverses a 2D array in a zigzag pattern and prints the elements.

## Overview

The `ZigzagTraversal` class contains a method `zigzagTraverse(int[][] matrix)` that takes a 2D integer array as input and prints its elements in a zigzag order.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this method with a sample 2D array.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty matrices, printing an error message in such cases.
-   Traverses the matrix in a zigzag pattern, moving diagonally down-left and up-right.
-   Prints the elements with spaces between them.
-   Prints a newline character after the zigzag traversal is complete.
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
